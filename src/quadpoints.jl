"""
    pw = quadpoints(chart, rule)

Returns a collection of (point, weight) tuples corresponding to the numerical quadrature `rule`
defined on the domain of `chart`. The weights returned take into account the Jacobian determinant
resulting from mapping from the reference domain to the configuration space.

Functions can be integrated like:

```julia
PW = quadpoints(chart, rule)
I = sum(pw[2]*f(pw[1]) for pw in PW)
```

Computed a matrix of vectors containing (weight, point, value) triples that can

this method used `quadpoints(chart, rule)` to retrieve the points and weights for
a certain quadrature rule over `chart`.
